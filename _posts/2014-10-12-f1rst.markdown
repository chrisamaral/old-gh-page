###~~~ what###
*I think you will find* that this is actually my fifth website/blog-thing. All the others died a tragic death.

###~~~ why###
Because all the main blog plataforms suck, ever since I heard about static site generators (not much longer than a year ago) I was hooked. But I'm a stupid skriddie, so I started with metalsmith. 

Turns out `<SPOILER>` the docs are as awful as you'd expect `</SPOILER>` and the whole thing feels too node-ish for just a html generator. So I gave up being a smartass and installed Jekyll.

###WTF###
So here am I, looking at this folder containing <u>literally</u> thousands of html documents as I realize something embarassing. Although having spent the last 5 years writing web sites/apps I can't remember the last time I wrote a fucking html document (close tags and all).

...but <del>even after admitting this, there is no catharsis</del> that's all, thanks for reading and welcome to my new blog. 

Wish me luck.
